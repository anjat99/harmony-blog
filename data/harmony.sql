(1, 'Photography Ideas to Improve Your Photography', 'Are you stuck in a photographic rut? Are you looking to boost your creativity with new photography ideas?\r\nThere are so many different photography techniques out there. Where do you start?\r\nLook no further. We have compiled a list of  the most interesting photography ideas, ranging from simple post-production edits to day-long projects.\r\n\r\n1. Reflections\r\nThe use of reflections in your photography can add gorgeous depth and structure to your images.\r\nThey can turn average landscapes and cityscapes into something extraordinary. Use a wide-angle lens to capture a wider field of view, for full effect.\r\nBut don’t limit yourself to photographing lakes or rivers; puddles in city streets, fountains or even small ponds can give great reflection results.\r\n\r\n2. Look for Shadows\r\nShadow photography is a great way to add drama, mystery, and emotion to your portrait photography.\r\nYou can add anonymity to an image if you isolate the shadow alone, without showing the subject. You can use shadows of any subject to create this kind of effect.\r\n\r\n3. Shoot during the Golden Hour\r\nThe golden hour is the hour after sunrise or before sunset.\r\nTaking photos during this time adds a beautiful diffused warm hue to your images. It also extends shadows as the sun is at a lower point in the sky.\r\nIn addition, the golden hour allows a more even exposure, which enhances depth and detail in your subjects.\r\n\r\n4. Catch a Sunset\r\nFollowing on from the golden hour, a sunset offers some of the most beautiful photography. It works particularly well when dark silhouettes are in the foreground, such as a skyline, mountain or trees in a forest. This photography idea enhances the overall structure of your image, as well as creating a stunning distinction between a vivid, colorful background and a darker, shadowy foreground.  \r\n\r\n5. Shoot Wide Angle\r\nUsing a wide-angle lens for photography is particularly useful if you are shooting interiors, architecture, or vast landscapes. Make sure you have a clear subject in your framing to draw the viewer’s eye. Otherwise, you will be getting a dull photo.', 'Note from the authors: all the material presented in this article is based on our field experience and years of shooting, and our recommendations and guidance are based on that.', 1, '2021-04-09 11:25:18', 4, 1, 4, '2021-04-08 17:55:01', '2021-04-09 09:25:18'),
(2, 'Is it Ethical to Travel Now? With that Freedom Comes Responsibility', '“Is it ethical to travel now?” The relationship between freedom and responsibility might provide you the answer.\r\n\r\nPopular question these days. The temptation to answer “yes” or “no” misses the opportunity to separate the issues facing travelers, including that our freedom to travel carries with it a \r\npersonal responsibility — just as it always has.\r\n\r\nFreedom, Responsibility and Meaning: The Travel Payoff\r\n“Freedom, however, is not the last word. Freedom is only part of the story and half of the truth. Freedom is but the negative aspect of the whole phenomenon whose positive aspect is \r\nresponsibleness. In fact, freedom is in danger of degenerating into mere arbitrariness unless it is lived in terms of responsibleness.”\r\n—Victor E Frankl, Man\'s Search for Meaning\r\n\r\nWhen we go out into the world – whether across the globe or around the block – we exercise a freedom. That freedom is paired with a responsibility to ourselves and to others. We can \r\nchoose to ignore that responsibility. If we do, we slowly — and usually imperceptibly — erode those freedoms.\r\n\r\nFor example, at home we have a responsibility to pick up after ourselves. If we throw trash on our streets and everyone follows suit, we live in garbage together. If we walk down the \r\nsidewalk as if the sidewalk is ours alone, and others do the same, we collide.\r\n\r\nWhen we travel, similar forces are at work, only the playing field is a bit larger.\r\n\r\nThe greater lesson in Frankl’s quote as it applies to travel: as we exercise our freedom, the care we take and the responsibility we choose to bear actually lends shape, meaning and value \r\nto our lived experience. As the frame of our travels expands from #whatismine to #whatisours, effort is required.\r\n\r\nShould You Travel Now?\r\n“Should I travel now?”\r\n\r\nIt’s a personal decision. That redirect is not just diplomatic avoidance. Instead, it implies that your answer ought to depend on the choices you make, how you intend to travel and \r\nwhether and how you care about the well-being of others along the way.\r\n\r\nIt applies whether you journey just outside your front door or halfway around the world.\r\nIt has always applied.\r\nAnd its truth remains with each of us until we take our last trip.', 'As we exercise our freedom, the care we take and the responsibility we choose to bear actually lends shape, meaning and value to our lived experience.', 1, '2021-04-09 11:43:14', 1, 2, 6, '2021-04-09 09:21:05', '2021-04-09 09:43:14'),
(3, 'Essential tips to have fabulous skin', 'Everyone has a favourite face cream or treatment, but beautiful skin starts with nourishment from within. Older cells are constantly shed and replaced by younger ones and a steady \r\nsupply of key nutrients is essential to support this rapid growth. Eat the correct balance of foods and you’ll feed your skin the vital nutrients it needs to help it stay soft, supple and \r\nblemish-free. \r\n\r\nThat said, as much as we may try to resist it, our skin does naturally age. Wrinkles and age spots are the inevitable result of time, but skin ageing may be sped up by overexposure to the \r\nsun and tanning beds, strong soaps, chemicals and poor nutrition. With this in mind, a holistic approach is best. Treat your skin kindly and optimise your nutrition by eating antioxidant-\r\nrich fruit and vegetables, healthy fats from oily fish and nuts, and a varied and balanced diet. This should give optimal levels of the nutrients that are crucial for radiant skin, including \r\nbeta carotene, vitamins C and E, zinc and selenium.\r\n\r\n1) Eat a minimum of five portions of fruit and vegetables every day\r\nFruit and vegetables contain powerful antioxidants that help to protect skin from the cellular damage caused by free radicals. Free radicals, smoking, pollution and sunlight can cause \r\nwrinkling and age spots. Eat a rainbow of colourful fruit and vegetables and aim for at least five portions a day. Betacarotene, found in carrots, sweet potatoes and pumpkin, and lutein, \r\nfound in kale, papaya and spinach are potent antioxidants, important for normal skin cell development and healthy skin tone.\r\n\r\n2) Eat enough vitamin C/E\r\nVitamin C is also a super antioxidant. It is needed to support the immune system, promote radiant skin and help blemishes heal properly. The best sources are blackcurrants, blueberries, \r\nbroccoli, guava, kiwi fruits, oranges, papaya, strawberries and sweet potatoes. Vitamin C is needed to produce collagen that strengthens the capillaries that supply the skin.\r\n\r\nVitamin E protects skin from oxidative (cell) damage and supports healthy skin growth. Foods high in vitamin E include almonds, avocado, hazelnuts, pine nuts and sunflower and corn \r\noils.\r\n\r\n3)Drink six to eight glasses of water a day\r\nSkin needs moisture to stay flexible. Even mild dehydration will cause your skin to look dry, tired and slightly grey. Drink six to eight glasses of water a day – all fluids count towards your \r\ndaily allowance, but water is the best. If you work in an office, keep a large bottle of water on your desk to remind you to drink. Herbal, caffeine-free teas are good too. Don’t forget that \r\nsome fruit and vegetables, such as watermelon, courgette and cucumber, also contribute fluids – the added benefit is that the minerals they contain will increase the rate you hydrate your \r\nbody and skin.', 'In order to have skin that glows and looks healthy and actually is healthy, you need to look at the whole picture and have a holistic approach to it. A lot of it is exercising regularly, drinking enough water, getting enough sleep, and keeping stress down. --Allison Williams', 1, '2021-04-09 13:17:24', 5, 3, 6, '2021-04-09 11:04:59', '2021-04-09 11:17:24'),
(4, 'Taking a Tour in India: Pros and Cons', 'Should I travel to India on an organized tour? Or should I travel India independently or solo? We’ve experienced India both ways – the first couple trips on our own and our most recent trip on a small group tour. Recent conversations with our audience, especially solo female travelers, told us a look at the benefits and downsides of small group travel and tours in India was in order.\r\n\r\nIndia is one of our favorite countries. At turns it is complicated yet simple, beautiful and tragic. It overwhelms the senses and is chock full of history, culture and humanity. This is one of the reasons why Dan chose it as his first trip abroad outside North America. It\'s why we’ve visited four times and why we have plans to return. However, the same features can make India a challenging and overwhelming independent travel destination.\r\n\r\nDuring our most recent visit to India, we traveled to northern India on a tour book-ended by two train trips. Considering our previous travels there – independent, to offbeat locations, plenty of train journeys – a reader asked why we chose a tour and didn\'t organize train tickets and all else ourselves.\r\n\r\nPros: The benefits of taking a tour in India\r\nIndia can feel overwhelming and challenging navigate no matter what, but especially if it’s your first visit to the country, and even more so if you are new to international travel. In these circumstances, an organized tour handles the general structure and logistics of the trip and supplies a tour leader to give continual local context and help make sense of the often disorienting commotion so can focus yourself on a deeper understanding and appreciation of the place you’re visiting.\r\n\r\n\r\nBenefits of an India tour for young female travelers\r\nTraveling in India can be a challenge for young women, especially those who stand out with light hair and fair skin. Although encounters with men are not on the whole physically dangerous, the intensity of attention afforded to young women in India can be unpleasant or even feel invasive. To prepare, here are some travel safety tips for women traveling in India.\r\n\r\nTraveling in a group tour helps offers a bit of a shield from some of that attention. It offers the guide and other passengers an opportunity to step in during uncomfortable situations. Having a local tour leader and guide also provides an additional level of protection.\r\n\r\nFor example, we traveled with four young blonde women on our northern India itinerary. Their appearance literally stopped traffic. Cars pulled over, disgorging local passengers eager to take selfies with them. In circumstances where crowds of people gathered around them, the intensity bumped up a notch. If each woman had been traveling independently — without the buffer of our group and the watchful eye of our local tour leader — the feeling could become more overwhelming, turning to something frightening or even violating.\r\n\r\nBenefits for solo travelers\r\nRegardless of whether you are male or female, traveling solo to India for the first time can feel daunting and disorienting. There are also endless stories of scams to which travelers have fallen prey in India. Having a local guide to ask about things and the support of a group of fellow passengers can help mitigate some of those risks and smooth the travel experience.\r\n\r\nCons: The down side of taking a tour in India\r\nAn organized tour may not be the best option for every traveler, or for every situation. Here are some of the potential downsides of taking a group trip in India:\r\n\r\nToo fast paced: A fixed itinerary can feel as though you’re moving quickly with early mornings and long days packed with lots to see and do. This is true anywhere, but especially in India where sensory overload combined with limited rest can take its toll.\r\nNot as much time to explore independently: We find that some experiences, particularly interactions with locals, happen more naturally when we’re on our own, rather than in a group. For example, chatting with market vendors, being invited for tea, random conversations with people on the street, or just getting lost and discovering something unexpected. Solo or independent travelers can appear more approachable to locals than a large group might.\r\nCost: Organized tours can be more expensive than choosing to arrange everything yourself, taking public transport everywhere and traveling without a guide. Those are also the same reasons that many prefer to pay a little extra for a tour.\r\nLess street food exploration: Although all the meals on our tour were optional, we opted often to join the group as they were a fun group of people and we enjoyed their company. Because of this, we found that we ate street food or cafeteria food less often than we might have if we were traveling independently. For good reason and hygiene concerns, our tour guide tended to be more conservative with restaurant choices. The upside was that everyone in our group usually ordered different dishes and was open to sharing so we could sample different flavors and curries. And, no one in our group got sick during the trip.', NULL, 1, '2021-04-09 15:21:39', 1, 4, 12, '2021-04-09 12:06:03', '2021-04-09 13:21:39'),

(6, 'The Climate Crisis in Travel: Are We Missing the Bigger Picture?', 'As we respond to the climate crisis and consider tourism’s role in it, we wonder if we might be missing a bigger picture – and a greater opportunity — by focusing so squarely on flights. We offer some research and tools to travelers and the tourism industry to help season and expand our thinking on the topic.\r\n\r\nAs we read about the climate crisis and the role that travel and tourism plays, we’ve noticed a prevailing theme: carbon emissions from flights and aviation are the problem.\r\n\r\nSure, this is a central issue. The reality is that flights do contribute considerably to global carbon emissions and this is only expected to rise as passenger numbers increase. In recognition of that, we’ve examined our own thinking and committed to the Tourism Declares framework in an effort to reduce the number of flights we take per year for professional and personal reasons.\r\n\r\nHowever, flights aren’t the only problem at the intersection of tourism, carbon emissions and the climate crisis. In fact, even if we stopped flying altogether, we’d miss some of the travel industry’s greatest environmental impact and carbon emissions reduction opportunities of all. We\'d also lose out on many of the potential socio-economic and conservation-oriented benefits that travel and tourism deliver to the places we fly to and the people who live there. \r\n\r\nClimate Crisis and Travel\r\nTo date, carbon offsets have served as the tourism industry’s form of penitent indulgence or get-out-of-jail-free for flight-based carbon emissions. However many experts argue it doesn\'t really solve the problem. We tend to agree.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the actions that travelers and tourism companies take on the ground once the plane has landed and their holidays begin has gained greater attention and scrutiny.\r\n\r\nFor example, recent research from Responsible Travel regarding carbon emissions from holidays found a surprising result: that the carbon footprint from food — or foodprint —  can sometimes be greater than that of the transport used to reach the holiday destination.', 'Note to travelers: Although the first part of this article is more industry-oriented, you might find the background interesting as to how travel companies can measure and make changes to reduce their carbon footprint.', 1, '2021-04-09 15:22:00', 1, 6, 12, '2021-04-09 12:44:47', '2021-04-09 13:22:00'),
(7, 'How Americans Became Convinced Their Halloween Candy was Poisoned', 'Rumors of tainted, poisoned or otherwise murderous Halloween candy handed out to unsuspecting youngsters are as much a part of the Halloween tradition as costumes and sing-song pleas for sweets. The myth goes like this—no kid is safe on October 31 because psychotic murderers may hand out tainted treats to trick-or-treating children.\r\n\r\nBut is poisoned Halloween candy a terrifying threat or an urban legend?\r\n\r\n“Many, if not most, reports of Halloween sadism are of questionable authenticity,” write sociologists and criminal justice experts Joel Best and Gerald T. Horiuchi.\r\n\r\nWhen they conducted an extensive study on so-called “Halloween sadism,”\r\n\r\nor crimes specifically committed using Halloween treats or customs, they concluded that the threat is greatly exaggerated. Though both parents and kids are taught to be on the alert for tampered-with sweets, most of the cases the researchers analyzed were either overstated or could not be linked to Halloween itself.\r\n\r\nBest and Horiuchi suggest that fears of Halloween sadism rise during fearful times. For example, paranoia about tainted candy spiked in the early 1980s after a rash of Tylenol poisonings in which cyanide-laced acetaminophen was placed on store shelves and sold. The high-profile crime led to the introduction of childproof containers and tough federal laws aimed at punishing those who tamper with drugs. After the Tylenol murders, which are still unsolved, warnings about adulterated Halloween candy increased.\r\n\r\nWhile the fears may be overblown, Halloween crimes involving poison have occurred.\r\n\r\nIn 1964, for example, a New York woman named Helen Pfeil was arrested for handing out things like ant poison and dog biscuits to kids. When questioned, the housewife said that she was joking and that she gave the items to kids she felt were too old to be trick-or-treating. Though no children were poisoned during the incident, law enforcement didn’t find her actions funny.\r\n\r\nThe most infamous Halloween poisoning took place on October 31, 1974. That’s when a Texas man named Ronald O’Bryan gave cyanide-laced pixie sticks to five children, including his son. The other children never ate the candy, but his eight-year-old son, Timothy, did—and died soon after.\r\n\r\nThough nobody saw O’Bryan put the cyanide in the candy, investigators learned that O’Bryan had recently taken life insurance policies out on his children. He was convicted of murder and executed via lethal injection in 1984. Though it’s been decades since the crime, the “Candyman” murder still looms large in the memories of many parents on Halloween.', 'These chilling candy poisonings might make you rethink trick-or-treating.', 1, '2021-04-09 15:21:29', 5, 7, 11, '2021-04-09 12:47:24', '2021-04-09 13:21:29'),

They\'re catnip for avid travellers, inspiring a sense of adventure that\'s fuelled grand expeditions and tall tales.\r\n\r\nWe see our lives reflected in the stones, imagine our intimate dramas against their romantic, crumbling backdrops. And if a pall of disaster hangs over many lost cities, even that is softened by passing time.\r\n\r\n\"For probably thousands of years, people have been telling adventure stories about dramatic lands beyond our borders – stories about ancient civilisations,\" said Annalee Newitz, author of Four Lost Cities: A Secret History of the Urban Age.

Their frenzy was fuelled, in part, by a quest for history\'s most famous lost city: the island nation of Atlantis, which first appeared in Plato\'s writing. His fictional Atlantis thrived before moral decline brought divine punishment. The philosopher\'s contemporaries would have recognised the story as an allegory, said ancient historian Greg Woolf, author of The Life and Death of Ancient Cities: A Natural History.\r\n\r\n\"Telling a myth to illustrate some greater truth was widely understood,\" Woolf said. \"I don\'t think that anyone seriously believed [Atlantis] existed, but it was a convenient myth.\" When Plato\'s writing about Atlantis was distributed in modern translations, however, it found a more credulous audience. \r\n\r\n\"People were reading this at exactly the same time as people are founding colonies in the New World,\" explained classicist Edith Hall in a recent interview with BBC\'s History Extra Podcast. Misunderstanding Plato\'s work, many read the allegorical tale literally, Hall said. \"It blew their minds.

It is the way that we cooked the majority of the time,\" he said.

There wasn’t a skerrick left. And they haven’t come back.”\r\n\r\nAustralia’s forgotten reef\r\n\r\nTasmania’s giant kelp forests formed part of what’s known as the Great Southern Reef, a vast system of temperate rocky reefs stretching some 8,000km from Kalbarri in Western Australia, down and around Australia’s rugged southern coast and Tasmania and up into northern New South Wales.\r\n\r\nDespite 70% of Australia’s population living within 50km of the Great Southern Reef, most people have never heard of it. To be fair, this unique marine environment didn’t even have a name until 2016, when a team of scientists led by University of Western Australia (UWA) marine biologists Scott Bennett and Thomas Wernberg argued that this was part of its identity problem.\r\n\r\nDominated by kelp forests that sustain life in this biodiversity hotspot, the Great Southern Reef is home to hundreds of species not found anywhere else on Earth (including all three known seadragon species, seahorse-like creatures that look just as mystical as they sound), with an estimated 10,000 additional species yet to be identified. The reef also props up fishing and tourism industries worth approximately $10bn to the Australian economy, with its lucrative southern rock lobster and abalone industries alone worth four times the value of commercial fishing activities on the Great Barrier Reef.\r\n\r\nBut while most scientists agree the Great Southern Reef is in better general health than its northern counterpart, climate change is an increasing threat. While rising ocean temperatures have led to devastating coral bleaching events on the Great Barrier Reef, it’s kelp that suffers when ocean temperatures increase further south. And just as marine scientists are trying to save the Great Barrier Reef with technologies ranging from “coral IVF” to the development of a heat-resistant micro-algae, scientists around the Great Southern Reef are also trialling methods to protect its foundation species.', 'Many people think coral only grows in the tropics, but we get beautiful cold-water corals on the Great Southern Reef', 1, '2021-04-09 16:14:10', 1, 14, 2, '2021-04-09 13:59:21', '2021-04-09 14:14:10'),

Could travellers be the key to their success?\r\nThe rise of carbon removal tech\r\n\r\nBorn out of the Kyoto climate talks in 1997, carbon offsetting has long struggled with an image problem. Offsetting schemes allow people to invest in environmental projects designed to sequester carbon emissions (such as planting trees) or prevent emissions from occurring (such as renewable energy projects), but a lack of regulation and accountability in the early days fuelled widespread distrust of their effectiveness.\r\n\r\nMore recently, the wildfires that have ripped through Australia, California and the Amazon have magnified the issues involved with forestry-based offsetting schemes (when a tree burns, it releases its entire carbon stash back into the atmosphere).\r\n\r\nThe difficulty in accurately quantifying most carbon-offsetting programmes (it’s difficult to gauge, for example, the volume of emissions you’ll offset by contributing to a clean cookstove project, an energy efficiency initiative typically funded by offsetting organisations) hasn’t helped.\r\n\r\nThen came Climeworks, a Swiss start-up that pioneered a technology that sucks carbon out of the air and turns it into stone, effectively removing carbon emissions from the atmosphere instantly, safely and permanently.\r\n\r\nLocated on the mossy slopes of an active volcano in south-west Iceland, Climeworks’ first carbon removal plant with a permanent storage facility commenced in 2017. Powered by waste heat from a geothermal energy plant, it harnesses direct air capture technology (DAC) to draw ambient air into giant vacuum cleaner-like machines called CO2 collectors. The carbon is then separated from the captured air, combined with water and pumped 700m underground. Through natural mineralisation, the carbon dioxide reacts with basalt rock and turns into stone within a few years, while the remaining air simply returns to the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nLike planting trees and fertilising the ocean, DAC is what’s known as a carbon dioxide removal solution, or negative emissions technology. These solutions typically form the basis of carbon-offsetting projects supported by airlines such as Qantas and Delta, with most carriers now aligned with projects verified by the likes of Gold Standard and the Verified Carbon Standard. Once considered much less important than reducing emissions from the outset when it comes to mitigating climate change, carbon dioxide removal solutions received significant scientific endorsement in 2018 when the publication of the IPCC report on keeping the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C this century identified that these technologies would be essential in reaching climate targets “with limited or no overshoot”.', 'Until we come up with a genuinely sustainable way of flying people around the planet, we need to fly less', 0, '2021-04-09 16:01:47', 1, 15, 2, '2021-04-09 14:01:47', '2021-04-09 14:01:47'),

Back in 2008, then-president Mohamed Nasheed made global headlines by announcing a plan to buy land elsewhere so his citizens could relocate should islands become submerged. That plan gave way to considering whether it might be best to work with the sea rather than against it, by building floating urban developments – as has been done in cities like Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nInstead, the Maldives turned to a different form of geo-engineering: creating a 21st-Century city, dubbed the “City of Hope”, on a new, artificial island christened Hulhumalé.\r\n\r\nPre-Covid, curious tourists could visit the new island city as it takes shape around 8km from the capital city of Malé by hopping on a 20-minute bus from the airport over the bridge.

Set against a gunmetal-grey sky, a rich autumnal carpet was draped over valleys and mountains alike, giving the distant mountain summits of Ben Loyal and Morven a softness as the clouds gathered at their nape. A deep inky pool called a dubh lochan, meaning “black water” in Scottish Gaelic, rippled in the morning light, reflecting the moodiness of the passing sky.\r\n\r\nI was in Flow Country: the wild heartland of Scotland. Its name stems from the Old Norse floi, meaning “wet marshy ground”, and the area extends in a broad sweep from the mountainous ranges of the North-West Highlands towards the eastern coastline of the Moray Firth, covering 200,000 hectares between the counties of Caithness and Sunderland.\r\n\r\nAlready a week into my stay, I was volunteering for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), helping the team with land conservation. The Flow Country is Europe’s largest blanket bog, a type of wetland formed from peat, and one of Scotland’s most valuable environmental assets. Almost 150,000 hectares is designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), with the RSPB Forsinard Flows reserve caring for 21,000 hectares of it.\r\n\r\n“If you’ve got any interest in climate change, restoring and protecting peatland should be very close to the top of your list,” said Joe Perry, coordinator of the Flow Country’s recent bid for Unesco World Heritage Site status. If the bid is successful, the area will gain international recognition for its environmental value. He explained, “It’s a habitat that is really underrepresented.”\r\n\r\nIt is not hard to see why. A “bog” doesn’t necessarily fit the visual narrative of, say, the Grand Canyon or the Great Barrier Reef. There is no “charismatic megafauna,” as Perry put it. Instead, “It’s about everything you can’t see; what’s underneath the surface.”\r\n\r\n“The more you look the more you see” was a maxim I often heard used in relation to the peatland. This is a slow, granular world that eventually makes itself known. Its acidic, anaerobic conditions act as a natural preservative, as exhibited by its faithful cataloguing of social and climatic events across the Holocene. Among other discoveries, researchers have found fossilised pine stumps dating from 4500BC, remnants of an ancient forest that the Romans later called “the Great Wood of Caledon”; a Celtic War Horn from the 1st Century; and car exhaust particles from the 20th Century.\r\n\r\nWhen we think of the “wild” we usually imagine vast tracts of land, pristine and untouched. In the US, spaces like these have been sustained through the 1964 American Wilderness Act, which protects landscapes in which “the Earth and its community of life are untrammelled by man”. But in Britain, although 34.9% of land is termed “semi-natural” or “natural”, these categories include areas impacted by human development. What little untouched land remains is mostly in the Highlands, of which Flow Country claims some of the last truly wild pockets.\r\n\r\nI had never experienced the feeling of “wildness” before. Carrying out my tasks, trundling miles to collect wildlife camera SD cards from distant lochs, I soon found a simple happiness. As the fret of modern life collapsed, the natural world made itself heard and my dulled city senses began to wake up: the sonic vibrato of a snipe or the quick chirrup of a meadow pipit became deafeningly loud.\r\n\r\nFlow Country is one of the least-densely populated parts of Western Europe.

My first bommie not only turned out to be a spectacular sight, a miniature self-contained habitat like a tiny underwater island, but was enhanced by a gigantic manta ray gently flapping its wing-like fins, performing an underwater ballet right above it. When a turtle happened to swim by for good measure, the Great Barrier Reef had won me over completely.\r\n\r\nTalking to the other divers on the boat, we’d all been drawn to the Great Barrier Reef to see the world’s largest coral formation and its vast variety of ecological habitats and marine species. Not only were we spellbound by its otherworldly beauty, it made us understand the importance of preserving this precious environment.\r\n\r\nUnderwater tourism is opening the ocean up to travellers, offering them the chance to see the marine world that covers 70% of our planet. New, high-profile openings – such as the world’s first underwater hotel, the Conrad Maldives Rangali Island, which opened in 2018; the world’s largest underwater restaurant Under in Norway, opened in 2019; and the hot new trend of underwater art galleries, such as 2019’s Ngaro Underwater Sculpture Trail in Australia’s Whitsunday Islands – are all bringing more people into contact with marine sites.\r\n\r\nBut underwater tourism is hardly a new concept.\r\n\r\nJacques Cousteau invented general-use scuba gear in 1942, and the Professional Association of Diving Instructors, PADI, has issued 27 million diver certifications globally since 1967. According to Scubanomics, there are around 6 million active scuba divers in the world, plus countless snorkelling enthusiasts, who explore the edges of our oceans, diving sunken wrecks, swimming with whales and turtles and even going underwater caving. In addition, coastal resorts have long offered trips in glass-bottomed boats.\r\n\r\nMore recently, however, a shift in thinking has brought scuba-like adventure to people who are not skilled divers or swimmers or don’t have the time or means to earn diving certification. Experiences such as Seawalker on Green Island in the Great Barrier Reef allow people to submerge while wearing a large glass helmet. Dressed in a protective suit, “divers” are gently lowered to the ocean floor, where they quite literally walk upright on the sand, connected by tubes that allow them to breathe normally while underwater.\r\n\r\nThen there are submersible rides, which offer tours along reefs of some of the world’s most interesting islands and coastal regions, from Hawaii to Mauritius. These can range from larger submarines for groups of tourists to super-luxurious private subs, such as the ones by Deepflight that operate in the Four Seasons Resort in the Maldives. These environmentally friendly and air-conditioned crafts, with space for two people plus a pilot, have individual viewing domes that allow for an exclusive up-and-close experience.\r\n\r\nAlthough many believe these sleek submersibles may be the future of underwater exploration, since no scuba or swimming experience is necessary – plus the battery-operated and low-noise-level submersibles mean the experience is as sustainable as possible – they often carry a high price tag. The Deepflight, for example, costs $1,500 per couple for an hour’s excursion, which puts the experience out of reach of much of the general public.', 'There are ways to develop underwater tourism in a sustainable manner', 1, '2021-04-09 16:13:52', 1, 18, 2, '2021-04-09 14:07:30', '2021-04-09 14:13:52'),
(19, 'Why we procrastinate on the tiniest of tasks', 'When we put off small jobs, they balloon from tiny checklist items into major irritants. Why do we keep doing this?\r\nIt could be a quick email to a colleague you dislike. Perhaps it’s some menial paperwork; a small tweak to a spreadsheet or an invoice that has to be filed. It could even be a short phone call to your boss – something that will only take a minute and yet, somehow, for some reason, you keep on putting it off. \r\n\r\nIf it only takes five minutes, you end up asking yourself, then why on earth haven’t you done it? You waste time thinking about how annoying it is; unsurprisingly, that does not make it go away. Instead, the task lingers, ballooning from a tiny checklist item into an ongoing irritant completely out of proportion with the resources needed to actually polish it off. \r\n\r\nTiny tasks have a way of taking up an abnormally large amount of space in our minds. Yet, there are simple ways we can bring them back down to size, something that begins with understanding how exactly we allow them to loom so large. Then, by reframing our approach to the tasks, switching our emotional response and practicing some self-compassion we can work towards conquering the small to-do list items that trip us up. \r\n\r\nWhy tiny tasks become big monsters \r\n\r\nAt its core, procrastination involves the voluntary delay of an intended task, despite expecting to be worse off for doing so, explains Fuschia Sirois, professor of psychology at the University of Sheffield in England. “You get all kinds of people saying [procrastination is] good for this or good for that, but embedded within the definition is that no form of procrastination is ever good for you.” \r\n\r\nPeople who chronically procrastinate tend to have higher levels of stress, poor sleep patterns and worse job prospects, particularly when it comes to advancing into roles where autonomy and decision making are required. On the mental health front, procrastination is also linked to depression and anxiety. It can similarly undermine relationships, because when we procrastinate, we end up breaking commitments with others. \r\n\r\nIt’s easy to understand why we procrastinate on big tasks; they can be daunting or mentally draining and require loads of time, energy and commitment. On the other hand, small tasks can lead to a particularly pesky form of procrastination. Sirois says we don’t procrastinate on them because they slip our mind; rather, we make a conscious and intentional choice to put off something that might arouse doubt, insecurity, fear or feelings of incompetence.\r\n\r\nThis could be something as simple as filing unfamiliar paperwork or changing an ink cartridge when you don’t know how to, or something a bit more loaded, such as writing a short email to a colleague when you’re dreading their response. And although many believe that procrastinating on tasks like this has to do with poor time management, Sirois says it’s actually about mood management. \r\n\r\n“Procrastinators are not these happy-go-lucky lazy people that just kind of go ‘what the heck, I don’t really care’,” she says. “They’re actually really self-critical and they worry a lot about their procrastination.” \r\n\r\nThat worry sits in their minds and drains their cognitive resources, reducing their ability to problem-solve. It makes them think: what’s wrong with me? Why can’t I just get on with doing this little thing? And then they begin to ruminate on the task, increasing their negative feelings about it and hampering their ability to view it rationally for what it is. \r\n\r\n“So, you’ve got this little thing, where you had a bit of uncertainty, and now it’s growing into this big thing with all this fear and uncertainty and dread,” says Sirois. “It just becomes this monstrous thing – a molehill that’s now a mountain.”', 'It just becomes this monstrous thing – a molehill that’s now a mountain – Fuschia Sirois', 1, '2021-04-09 16:13:27', 3, 19, 2, '2021-04-09 14:10:17', '2021-04-09 14:13:27'),
(20, 'How asynchronous communication could change your workday', 'More of us are working different hours than our colleagues, reducing our real-time communication. Will it stay this way?\r\nOne colleague has moved from London to Dubai. Another has shifted his hours to manage childcare responsibilities. Don’t forget the person putting in two more hours at night than she did before. And you’re all collaborating on the same project.\r\n\r\nThis is asynchronous communication: exchanges that don’t happen in real time, but rather on your own time.\r\n\r\nAsynchronous communication isn’t new, and it’s possible that a part of your workday is already asynchronous. Maybe you’ve been a dealing with a client on a different coast or colleagues in different time zones, or maybe you have a habit of clearing your inbox before bed while everyone else is offline.\r\n\r\nBut after the pandemic forced many out of shared office buildings and into private spaces, asynchronous communication has become more ingrained in daily life. And although Zoom meetings and instant messaging are synchronous – meaning they happen in real time and immediately – many of us now work more on our own schedules, especially as we juggle other personal tasks. This makes working on the same clock as everyone else near impossible.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, this gives workers more freedom to work in a way that makes sense for our lives. However, some say asynchronous communication is slower and less collaborative, and can make us feel isolated. So, as more companies bang the drum of worker flexibility in the post-pandemic world, should we all expect to operate asynchronously in the future? And how will this change the way we do our jobs?\r\n\r\nNot the same as ‘remote’\r\n\r\nAlthough remote work often involves a lot of asynchronous communication, these two terms are definitively different.\r\n\r\n\"I think it is important to note that remote and async work are not equivalent,\" says Jen Rhymer, a researcher at Stanford University, who\'s looked at how companies implement both synchronous and asynchronous models. Some companies who have gone remote still expect workers to be at their home desks from nine to five, like they would at the office, and participate in synchronous activities like Zoom check-ins.\r\n\r\nIn asynchronous work, however, workers complete tasks on their own timetable, which may be very different to that of their colleagues. That means communication is not expected to be immediate – people respond when it\'s convenient, and within the hours of their own workdays. Online hubs, like Google Docs or Dropbox, help facilitate this way of working; people can access the resources they need on their own, and then send completed tasks to other colleagues, who can pick them up whenever their workday begins.\r\n\r\nOf course, teams and organisations who work across multiple countries have been acquainted with asynchronous working since well before the pandemic. If a company has staff in Tokyo, Paris and Los Angeles, for example, different time zones make it impossible to work synchronously all the time.\r\n\r\nWhat\'s different now is how the pandemic has made asynchronous communication far more common, even for companies with no international staff. No one is physically in the same space at the same time, and many people have ended up working unconventional hours to juggle caring for kids and other family members, for instance. That means that some workers who were used to having their colleagues alongside them from nine to five have been forced to shift to asynchronous working – which comes with both benefits and challenges. \r\n\r\nThe pros\r\n\r\n\"Remote and especially async work is an important option, but not a great fit for everyone; it is a mode of work that has trade-offs,\" says Rhymer. Advantages to working asynchronously include the ability to set aside time for deep thinking. \"When the expectation of an immediate response is removed, people are able to focus on their work for long periods of time while scheduling times of the day to reply to colleagues,” she says.\r\n\r\nAsynchronous work also makes it easier to onboard new employees, says Erica Brescia, COO of GitHub, a software company whose workforce was 70% remote before the pandemic, and which has been a vocal supporter of asynchronous working.\r\n\r\n“[New hires] have access to more information relevant to their work, and can easily follow the context around decisions that have been made prior to their start,\" says Brescia. This is because with asynchronous communication, more things have to be in writing so that people can read important information. And with everything documented, it\'s easier to bring people up to speed.\r\n\r\nAsynchronous communication can also help reduce meeting fatigue, she adds: senior staff can record weekly announcements that people can watch own their own time, for example.\r\n\r\nSetting your own schedule also heightens many of the existing benefits of remote work: location doesn\'t matter, you can work at your own pace in or out of traditional office hours and this makes it easier to juggle home responsibilities and work-life balance.\r\n\r\nThe cons\r\n\r\nOne potential downside of asynchronous working, however, is that way it can end up blurring the line between work and home – a boundary that’s already gotten fuzzier during the pandemic. It might be more tempting to check email at bedtime, for example, as teammates in other regions start coming online.\r\n\r\nWorking alone, on your own schedule, may also make you feel disconnected from the rest of your organisation, exacerbating Covid-19-era loneliness. Plus, communicating asynchronously with colleagues doesn\'t bring any of the immediate feedback or visual cues that in-person or  synchronous communication provides.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a surprising amount of burden falls on the worker to stay up to date and in touch with their organisation. Asynchronous communication \"gives people more autonomy in how they work, and with that comes more responsibility\", says Kristen Shockley, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Georgia, who specialises in applied psychology in business. So, while a company might allow employees to work to their own schedule, the worker then absorbs the responsibility to access team resources and manage their tasks in a way they wouldn’t in an office working ‘normal’ hours.\r\n\r\nUltimately, less hand-holding means the worker is responsible for their own productivity. But this asks for a lot of employer trust, which may open up problems of micromanagement. Shockley posits that asynchronous working might even lead to an increase in employee monitoring.\r\n\r\nExperts also say that socialising and informal conversations suffer under the asynchronous work model, as do brainstorming and collaborative creativity. It\'s much more difficult to have those \'water-cooler’ moments, and the interactions that do happen can be more easily misconstrued.', NULL, 1, '2021-04-09 16:14:21', 3, 20, 2, '2021-04-09 14:12:40', '2021-04-09 14:14:21'),
(21, 'The hydrogen revolution in the skies', 'A record-breaking commercial-scale hydrogen plane has taken off in the UK, with more set to join it soon. How far can such planes go in cutting the aviation industry\'s emissions?\r\ns the plane rose from the runway for what was to prove a smooth and uneventful flight, the team breathed a sigh of relief. The six-seater Piper M-Class had been fitted out at a research and development hub at Cranfield airport in the UK to run on hydrogen, and on this maiden flight in the late summer of 2020 everything worked perfectly. With that flight, ZeroAvia, the California-based start-up that had developed the aircraft with partners in Britain and elsewhere, was ready to move to the next stage in the journey towards zero carbon aviation.\r\n\r\nA catchphrase for the transition to a low or zero carbon economy is \"electrify everything\" – that is, create a world in which most human activities, from manufacturing and construction to transport and tourism, run on electricity generated from low or zero carbon sources such as wind, solar and perhaps nuclear power. But there is a problem: some sectors look to be hard if not impossible to electrify in the near and medium term, and aviation is, perhaps, foremost among them. \r\n\r\nBefore the pandemic grounded most flights, commercial aviation accounted for about 2.5% of global emissions of carbon dioxide. It sounds like a small proportion of the whole, but it is more than those of Germany (2.2%), and this is not the whole story. Carbon dioxide accounts for about half of aviation\'s contribution to what is known as its effective radiative forcing – that is, its total contribution to the factors that actually drive a rise in global average temperature. Contrails – water vapour trails from aircraft – are aviation\'s largest other factor.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that commercial aviation has an excellent track record in improving efficiency. Carbon dioxide emissions per passenger flight have fallen more than 50% since 1990 thanks to improved engines and operations. The bad news is that these gains have been overwhelmed by rising volumes of air traffic. This has increased by at least a fifth over the past five years, and is predicted to reach 10 billion passengers a year by 2050.\r\n\r\nAt first glance, hydrogen looks to be a good solution to the challenge of flying without wrecking the climate. Whether hydrogen is used to power a fuel cell to generate electricity or directly combusted for motive power, the only waste product is clean water. Importantly in the context of flight, hydrogen packs a lot of energy per unit of mass – three times more than conventional jet fuel, and more than a hundred times that of lithium-ion batteries. \r\n\r\nGovernments and companies are investing in this potential. ZeroAvia\'s 2020 hydrogen-powered flight, known as HyFlyer I, was supported by the UK Government, whose Jet Zero Council promises \"a laser focus on UK production facilities for sustainable aviation fuels and the acceleration of the design, manufacture and commercial operation of zero-emission aircraft.\"\r\n\r\nThe UK government, together with private investors and commercial partners are supporting ZeroAvia in the development of an aircraft with a hydrogen-electric (fuel cell) powertrain capable of carrying up to 20 passengers about 350 nautical miles (648km). ZeroAvia\'s founder and chief executive Val Miftakhov, says the company expects to offer commercial flights using such a plane as early as 2023, and that by 2026 it will be able to realise flights over a range of 500 nautical miles (926km) in aircraft with up to 80 seats. For 2030, Miftakhov has even bigger plans: \"We will have single-aisle jets, 100-seat category,\" he says.\r\n\r\nThere is ambition in mainland Europe too. Hydrogen \"is one of the most promising technology vectors to allow mobility to continue fulfilling the basic human need for mobility in better harmony with our environment\", says Grazia Vitaldini, chief technology officer at Airbus, the world\'s largest aircraft manufacturer. In September 2020, Airbus announced that hydrogen-fuelled propulsion systems would be at the heart of a new generation of zero-emissions commercial aircraft. The project, named ZeroE, is a flagship of the European Union\'s multibillion-euro stimulus package, aimed at greening the bloc\'s economy. \r\n\r\nAirbus has presented three concept planes which it says could be ready for deployment by 2035. The first is a turboprop (propeller) driven aircraft capable of carrying around 100 passengers about 1,000 nautical miles (1,850km). The second, a turbofan (jet), could carry 200 passengers twice as far. Both look similar to already existing planes, but ZeroE\'s third concept is a futuristic-looking blended-wing design that is a striking departure from commercial models today. Airbus says this third design could be capable of carrying more passengers over longer distances than the other two, but has not released more detail at this stage. All three designs are envisaged as hydrogen hybrids, which means they would be powered by gas-turbine engines that burn liquid hydrogen as fuel, and also generate electricity via hydrogen fuel cells.', 'Importantly in the context of flight, hydrogen packs a lot of energy per unit of mass', 0, '2021-04-09 16:19:51', 3, 21, 8, '2021-04-09 14:19:51', '2021-04-09 14:19:51'),

A day after returning to Earth \"space pilot\" Yuri Gagarin is, reports Ostroumov, \"in high spirits, hale and hearty…a wonderful smile illumines his face.\"\r\n\r\n\"Every now and then dimples appear on his cheeks,\" Ostroumov writes. \"He appreciates the curiosity with which he is pressed for the details of what he saw and experienced during the one and a half hours he spent outside the Earth.\"\r\n\r\nIn a booklet published to commemorate the flight, Soviet Man in Space, the interview with Gagarin continues for several pages. The cosmonaut describes the experience: \"The horizon presents a very unique and unusually beautiful sight.\" And praises the Soviet Union: \"I dedicate my flight to… all our people who are marching in the forefront of humanity and building a new society.\"\r\n\r\nIn a political system where journalism tends towards propaganda, rather than a realistic portrayal of events, it is easy to argue that Gagarin\'s quotes are made-up. But, although they might have been refined by censors, there is a good chance they are the cosmonaut\'s actual words.\r\n\r\nA fighter pilot who had grown up in a small Russian village, Gagarin was a well-liked family man. He was indeed good looking, personable and, crucially, a loyal card-carrying member of the communist party.\r\n\r\nAlthough the drama of Nasa\'s early human space programme played out in public, only recently has the full story of how Soviet Union selected and trained its cosmonauts emerged. The communist empire was keen to encourage the view that selection was open to all and that these first men in space – and the first woman, Valentina Tereshkova – were volunteers. But that is not strictly true.\r\n\r\nAfter qualifying as a fighter pilot, Gagarin is stationed at a remote airfield on the Russian border with Norway flying MiG-15 jet fighters on the western frontier of the Cold War. In late summer 1959, two doctors arrive at the base to interview a pre-selected group of aviators. After starting with a list of about 3,500 potential candidates, the doctors have already narrowed their search to some 300 pilots across the west of Russia.\r\n\r\n\"The guys being interviewed, have no clue really why they\'re being interviewed,\" says Stephen Walker the author of Beyond, who has spent years scouring Russian archives to piece together the full story of Gagarin\'s mission.\r\n\r\nThe interview consists of a seemingly casual chat about career, aspirations and family.

(23, 'Khasis: India\'s indigenous matrilineal society', 'In one of the world\'s last matrilineal societies, women control property and inheritance and dominate public spaces. So, why are some women seeing change as a good thing?\r\nDuring my travels across mainland India, especially in small towns and villages in the north, I hardly saw any women-run shops or marketplaces. In a sit-down eatery in Uttar Pradesh, I watched men make flatbreads and mash vegetables for curries while male customers gobbled them up. Between Kolkata and Gorakhpur, I sat sandwiched between men in passenger trains passing through the rural countryside. On most occasions, women were absent from public spaces.\r\n\r\nBut in the north-eastern Indian state of Meghalaya, things were different.\r\n\r\nIn Iewduh, one of region\'s oldest and largest open markets located in Meghalaya\'s capital city Shillong, women lined the crowded bazaar streets selling local vegetables, chopped meat and handmade crafts. Female elders called mei walked through the aisles controlling the trade and ordering men who worked for them to lift bags full of fresh produce.\r\n\r\nI returned to Meghalaya five more times before the pandemic halted my travels. During those visits, I saw that in many places in Meghalaya, women not only occupied space; they dominated them. That\'s because today, Khasis – who account for state\'s largest ethnic community ­– are one of the last existing matrilineal societies in the world. Here, children receive their mother\'s last name, husbands move into their wife\'s home, and the youngest daughters inherit the ancestral property.\r\n\r\nBut who are the Khasis?\r\n\r\nThere are many theories about their origin. According to local folklore, Khasis come from seven divine clans. In the 1967 book, The History And Culture Of The Khasi People by Hamlet Bareh, the Indian author and historian traces them to an ancient Austric race in South-East Asia who descended from a Mon-Khmer group of people in the remote Burmese jungles. While it\'s uncertain when Khasis migrated west to the mountains and foothills of north-eastern India, linguistic evidence shows that their language – Khasi – has similarities to Mon-Khmer dialects.\r\n\r\nToday, most Khasis live in Meghalaya, which became an independent state in 1972. During the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, some Khasi families became separated and now live across the border from Meghalaya in Bangladesh. Another significant portion of the population lives in the neighbouring Indian state of Assam.\r\n\r\nKhasi historian Amena Nora Passah, who teaches at North-Eastern Hill University in Shillong, said that Khasis are people of oral tradition. But ironically, according to oral history, they have patriarchal roots.\r\n\r\nAs warriors who often battled with other groups for land, Khasi men often went down to the plains for clashes. During those battles, some men died. Others settled for a new life in the plains. Left without their partners, Khasi women would remarry or find other partners, and it often became difficult to determine a child\'s paternity.', 'A Khasi woman never joins her husband\'s household, rather he joins hers', 1, '2021-04-09 16:29:29', 1, 23, 3, '2021-04-09 14:25:33', '2021-04-09 14:29:29'),

So far, he has covered 12,000km and is currently stuck in Myanmar due to a pandemic-induced border clampdown.\r\n\r\nA scientist by training, Salopek says his project is about storytelling; an experiment in slow and immersive journalism.

Borders are closed. Movement is restricted. I’ve paused the walk in northern Myanmar, waiting for things to open back up. Fortunately, among the things that walking teaches is patience.\r\n\r\nIn my immediate horizons, not much has changed. Farmers are cultivating rice. Lorries bump along jungle roads bringing the next consignment of beer and taking away river fish or timber. I’m lucky. Myanmar has a very low morbidity and mortality rate. The reasons are not entirely known and probably complicated. They may include some background level of resistance because humans and wild coronaviruses have been coexisting in this tropical environment for millennia.

I looked, but it was right on to baggage claim for me. I’d managed to get into England without a UK stamp on my passport. Weird.\r\n\r\nI was excited for my first visit to London. My friends live about 45 minutes away from Heathrow in North London. Or at least it should be 45 minutes. Halfway back to their flat, the tube (train) broke down. We got stuck in the train for over an hour, turning the ride from the plane to the flat into a 2.5-hour ordeal.\r\n\r\nYet the train ride would have been bearable even with jetlag, had not another passenger decided she wanted to sing the whole time.\r\n\r\nThis old woman, an obvious American Idol reject, began singing (or rather murdering) what sounded like Chinese folk songs as loud as she could.\r\n\r\nAt first, it wasn’t that bad…but she got progressively louder and louder.\r\n\r\nIt’s funny how you can learn a lot about a culture in instances like this. The English are famously reserved. My friends couldn’t stand the woman, but when I told them they should say something (I didn’t want to be the loud American tourist), they replied, “Ohh no, I’m far too polite for that. I don’t want to cause a scene.”\r\nThe other passengers seemed to feel the same way. The English are known for their reserve and politeness, and rather than be perceived as impolite, they’d tolerate an annoyance such as this. In America, the whole train would have thrown that woman out.\r\n\r\nUnable to take it, I said something. Then I said it again. Everyone else seemed to mumble in approval. She just looked at me and gave me a thumbs-up. A guy across from her laughed and began to sing along. Soon they were both singing and the train was mumbling in even more discontent. Yet there was no revolution. English manners still prevailed.\r\n\r\nBut I had had enough, and, lest I look too improper, got my friends and switched carriages. It took two carriages before the woman’s singing faded away, but silence finally filled the stale train air.\r\n\r\nToday, I’ve been exploring London. With the city being so massive, I divided the city into little sections. First, I explored the Thames River and the plethora of sights around it. I saw Trafalgar Square and walked down Whitehall Street where all the governmental offices are until I came upon Big Ben.\r\n\r\nThere I was in front of the icon of London and, gazing upon this giant clock, I was disappointed. I had expected him to be… bigger.\r\n\r\nThe Parliament tower went higher than Ben. I had always pictured Ben to be very tall (not that he’s short), and I’ll admit it was a little disappointing to see his stature. I guess all those angled shots from movies have ruined me, much like the close-ups of Mt. Rushmore hide the fact it, too, is tiny.\r\n\r\nNot to say it wasn’t beautiful — it was. Big Ben was still amazing and as I ate lunch in the shadow of him and Parliament, I couldn’t help but be in awe of their Gothic architecture. I’m glad Guy Fawkes didn’t blow them up. He would have robbed humanity of wonderful things.\r\n\r\nOne thing that did sadden me about London was all the congestion and construction around their tourist sights. Some of the best tourist cities in the world shield their historical sites from modern development. Philadelphia’s historic area is blocked, and parts of Rome are no-drive zones, as is the Parthenon in Athens. It allows you to enjoy the cities without having to dodge big double-decker buses.\r\n\r\nIf I had one complaint about London’s historical sites, it would be that. Attractions lose some of their historic wonder and magnificence when surrounded by construction crews, buses, and trains. It’s hard to throw yourself into the history when construction crews are blasting sidewalks behind green fences.\r\n\r\nI know it’s hard when cities are so big and congested, but if other places can do it, London could too.\r\n\r\nNow my Internet hour is up and it’s time to explore the famous Tower Bridge and the Tower of London before meeting my friend for dinner. It’s been a long day already, but I’ve barely scratched the surface of London.\r\n\r\nI’m excited to keep exploring!', '\"It is better to travel well than to arrive.\"', 1, '2021-04-09 16:52:18', 1, 25, 10, '2021-04-09 14:46:25', '2021-04-09 14:52:18'),
(26, 'IT’S TIME TO BE NOMADIC AGAIN!', 'Slightly more than a year ago, I flew home from Paris with the desire to do one thing: stay in place. I cleared my travel schedule, signed up for dating apps, and joined numerous social clubs in Austin with two goals in mind. I wanted to: (a) find a girlfriend and (b) expand my social circle and make new friends in Austin.\r\nI wanted to settle down and build a life for myself in the city. It was going to be a time when I planted some roots.\r\n\r\nLike most of you, in the past year, I’ve sat home a lot, read a lot, and cooked a lot — and was bored a lot. I’ve gone through bouts of “I’m going to make it through!” and sheer madness. It’s like this SNL skit (the video is only available in the US)\r\nI did “travel” some. I drove home to see my parents in Boston and had a few weeks in Maine.\r\n\r\nI spent six weeks in Mexico in an abortive attempt to live there for the winter. But, mostly, I was alone in my apartment. That’s not to say nothing good happened.\r\nThough we had to cancel it this year, I feel good about where we are with the future of TravelCon, and about where we are at in general when travel returns.\r\n\r\nAnd on a personal level, I got a lot better at cooking, learned to sleep better, cut down my alcohol consumption, and read a lot more than I normally do.\r\nBut here’s the thing: I never truly understood the phrase “you don’t know what you’ve got until it’s gone” until now.\r\n\r\nTravel — an integral part of my life, my career, my identity — was ripped away from me. So much of what I took for granted was gone quicker than those via Thanos’ snap.\r\n\r\nI may be an introvert, but travel is where I get to play the part extrovert — it’s the other side of this Gemini’s soul.\r\n\r\nBefore, I could go out in the world, be the extrovert, and then retreat to my house to books, Netflix, and my cozy introverted nature.\r\nThe pandemic has changed a lot about how I view life. While I still want to settle down here in Austin, right now, I have some living to do!\r\n\r\nLast year, the pandemic shut down the hostel I co-own in Austin. After a year of being empty, the building is finally being sold, which coincides with my apartment’s lease ending.\r\nSpecifically, there are a lot of national parks I haven’t been to yet that I want to see. I’ll drive west to the Grand Canyon, then up into Utah, visit all the parks there, then up to Boise, over to Portland, and down the coast to San Diego, where I’ll leave my car with a friend and fly to Boston.\r\n\r\nFrom there, I’d like to do Oman and Israel before going to Greece then trekking around the Balkans.\r\n\r\nOn the first part of the road trip, I mostly don’t plan on seeing people. In fact, I won’t run into friends until I hit Salt Lake City. Before that, it’ll be just me, lots of podcasts, takeaway food, and the great outdoors! Even though I long to hang out with people and hug strangers, I’ll wait until more of us are vaccinated for that.', NULL, 0, '2021-04-09 16:49:53', 1, 26, 10, '2021-04-09 14:49:53', '2021-04-09 14:49:53'),
(27, 'Brain Food: What To Eat While Studying Or Revising', 'Guide To The Best Foods To Eat While Studying\r\nLong hours at school and assessment seasons can be very hectic for everyone involved, right from students to teachers to parents. But parents get most affected as it means skewed or unhealthy diet for their children that could eventually lead to decreased energy, illness or poor performance at school.\r\n\r\nSo, in addition to paying attention to the academic strategies and techniques, providing the child with a right balanced diet is crucial in improving their memory, concentration and overall health.\r\n\r\nEating the right food can help build concentration, IQ, memory power, and more.

Essential Fatty Acids (EFAs) such as omega-3 fatty acids cannot be made by the body and needs to be obtained from the diet. Omega-3 fatty acids are important for making new neural pathways.\r\nThey keep the brain functioning smoothly and improve cognitive functions, memory, mental performance and behavioural functions. Moreover, these fish help to manage stress and release the feel-good chemical: serotonin. Vegetarians and vegans can get their supply of omega-3 fatty acids from soya beans, pumpkin seeds, walnuts, chia seeds, and linseeds. This is one of the Best Foods To Eat While Studying.\r\n\r\n--Bone Broth\r\nThis ancient food recipe is full of health benefits – from improving your immune system to overcoming food allergies. The amino acids in a bone broth help strengthen immunity and improve memory. Moreover, the food also helps get a peaceful sleep at night – an essential during assessment time!\r\n\r\n--Pumpkin Seeds\r\nIn addition to containing omega-3 fatty acids, pumpkin seeds are also rich in zinc. This valuable mineral is vital for enhancing memory and focus, improving brain power, and preventing memory loss. Eating pumpkin seeds also helps to reduce stress.\r\n\r\n--Coconut And Extra Virgin Olive Oil\r\nYou can never go wrong with coconut oil as it’s an extremely powerful brain food and also aids in preventing memory loss. Extra virgin olive oil contains powerful antioxidants that improve learning and memory and protects the brain from toxins. Remember to consume extra virgin olive oil cold or at room temperature only.\r\n\r\n--Whole Grains\r\nLike everything else, our brain requires energy to perform efficiently. With an adequate and steady supply of energy, the brain can concentrate and focus well throughout the day. This energy can come from carbohydrates i.e. glucose and the best source for that is having whole grain food. This is one of the Best Foods To Eat While Studying.', 'A healthy and balanced diet can solve much of our body’s problems. Giving children such brain food throughout the year will help them improve their brain function better and faster in the long run.
